// exercise 17 * 18

/*
Can a constant have an optional type? If you're not sure, try it and
see what happens.
Solution. Yes, a constant can have an optional type
let value: Int? = nil print(value)
let otherValue: Int? = 6 print(otherValue)
*/

/*
Why doesn't this work? What needs to be added to value on the
second line for this to work?
let value: Int? = 17 let banana: Int = value
*/

let value: Int? = nil
// because banana is an optional it needs to be unwrapped
let banana: Int = value ?? 0
print(banana)

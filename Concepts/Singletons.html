<h3>What is a Singleton</h3>
<p>
A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be 
created and gives access to that created instance. It contains static variables 
that can accommodate unique and private instances of itself. 
It is used in scenarios when a user wants to restrict instantiation 
of a class to only one object. This is helpful usually when a single object is 
required to coordinate actions across a system.

<h3>Advantages of Singletons</h3>
<p>
The singleton pattern is a very useful pattern. There are times that you want to 
make sure only one instance of a class is instantiated and that your application 
only uses that instance. That's the primary and only goal of the singleton pattern.
<br>
The default payment queue of the StoreKit framework is a fine example.

<h3>Disadvantages of Singletons</h3>
<p>
The singleton design pattern has a side effect that of global access.
<br>
Many developers use the singleton pattern to have easy access to 
the singleton object from anywhere in their project. The default payment 
queue is accessible through the default() class method is an example of this. 
<br>
By using singletons, you almost always sacrifice transparency for convenience.
Using singletons things maybe more tightly coupled.
<br>
An alternative to using singleton is dependency injection. 
While a key advantage of the singleton pattern is convenience, 
the most important advantage of dependency injection is transparency. 
Transparency is good.
<br>
If an object requires a valid user object to do its job,
 then that user object should be injected as a dependency. 
<br>
It's very difficult to write unit tests for code that uses singletons 
because it is generally tightly coupled with the singleton instance, 
which makes it hard to control the creation of singleton or mock it.
